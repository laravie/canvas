Code Generators for Laravel Applications and Packages
==============

**Canvas** replicates all of the `make` artisan commands available in your basic Laravel application. It allows everyone to use it: 

* outside of Laravel installation such as when building Laravel packages.
* with Laravel by allowing few customization to the stub resolved class and namespace.

Which can be execute via:

    php artisan make:migration CreatePostsTable --create

With **Canvas**, you can run the equivalent command via:

    composer exec canvas make:migration CreatePostsTable -- --create

### `canvas.yaml` Preset file

To get started you can first create `canvas.yaml` in the root directory of your Laravel project or package.

#### Laravel preset

You can run the following command to create the file:

    composer exec canvas preset laravel

Which will output the following as `canvas.yaml`:

```yaml
preset: laravel

namespace: App

model:
  namespace: App
```

#### Package preset

You can run the following command to create the file:

    composer exec canvas preset package

Which will output the following as `canvas.yaml`:

```yaml
preset: package

namespace: PackageName
user-auth-provider: App\User

paths:
  src: src
  resource: resources

factory:
  path: database/factories

migration:
  path: database/migrations
  prefix: ''

console:
  namespace: PackageName\Console

model:
  namespace: PackageName

provider:
  namespace: PackageName

testing:
  namespace: PackageName\Tests
```

> You need to change `PackageName` to the root namespace for your package.


Alternatively, you can set `--namespace` option to ensure the namespace is used in the file:

    ./vendor/bin/canvas preset package --namespace="Foo\Bar"

```yaml
preset: package

namespace: Foo\Bar
user-auth-provider: App\User

paths:
  src: src
  resource: resources

factory:
  path: database/factories

migration:
  path: database/migrations
  prefix: ''

console:
  namespace: Foo\Bar\Console

model:
  namespace: Foo\Bar
  
provider:
  namespace: Foo\Bar

testing:
  namespace: Foo\Bar\Tests
```

### Integration with Laravel

By default, you can always use `composer exec canvas` for Laravel and Packages environment. However, with the Package Discovery `Orchestra\Canvas\LaravelServiceProvider` will be installed automatically and override all default `make` command available via artisan so you can use it without changing anything.
